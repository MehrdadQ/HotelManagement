# HotelManagement
A simple hotel management system I wrote using C++ for my midterm assignment in my final year of high school.

You can book a room, review a reservation, cancel a reservation, and view all reservations.
You can also use the "advance" command which will simulate the passing of time and will provide reminders for reservations.
